## Application Architecture

TBA

## Development

```bash
npm i && nvm use && npm run storybook
```

### While using a consuming application

You can use the `npm link` command to actively develop on Aesop Gel and have the changes reflected in your consuming app.

```bash
# run inside aesop-gel to create a global link to be used
npm link

# run inside aesop-gel to get a link to the consumer's react
npm link ../aesop-web-ui/node_modules/react

# run inside aesop-web-ui to use your local aesop-gel build
npm link aesop-gel

# finally run this to update the built files on changes
npm run build:watch
```

### VS Code

Visual Studio  code struggles to make sense of aliased imports which are being utilised in this project.
To address this you can use a `jsconfig.json` with a sample shown below. More information can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig)

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist"
  ]
}
```

## Production

Rollup buils ES Modules for this project

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

## Git Workflow

This project adopts a simplified version of the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

`feature` (or `update`, or `bugfix` where appropriate) branches are branched from `develop`, and are merged back into `develop` after an approved Pull Request.

`hotfix` branches can be merged into `master` if they originate from `master`.

`master` is always the updated stable version that truthfully represent production code.

### Releasing code
This project follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The version number is automatically maintained by the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) package.

Commits to the `develop` branch will be released on the `develop` channel. These will be tagged as follows `v1.2.3-develop.4`. These can be thought of as 'beta' builds. The final number `.4` in the example above will be incremented until the `develop` branch is merged into `master`.

When `develop` is merged into `master` a release will be created. These will be tagged as `v1.2.3` (Note the `master` should also be merged back into `develop` at this point so both branches contain a 'full' git tag history).

These versions can be refrenced in other projects by adding `"aesop-gel": "github:aesop/aesop-gel#1.2.3",` to the package.json file. Generally the `master` releases should only be used. However during development and testing it may make sense to use the `develop` or 'beta' builds.

Changes to the version number are calculated automatically via the CI flow. In short commits with a `feat` type will increment the `minor` version, commits with a `fix` type will increment the `patch` version.

See [Commit messages](#commit-messages) below for more information.

### Commit messages
Commit messages follow the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Details about each commit message type are explained in this [article](https://medium.com/@menuka/writing-meaningful-git-commit-messages-a62756b65c81). The basis of this is built around `type(scope?): subject` and is enforced by [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).


#### Examples

```feat(AES-123): add XComponent section```

```fix: issue with XComponent CSS```

```style: clean up whitespace issues```

### Breaking changes
Breaking changes should generally avoid, however they can be made in two ways;
  - by adding `!` after the commit type `feat(aes-123)!: change all the APIs!`
  - by adding `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commit body
  ```
    feat(aes-123): change all the APIs!

    BREAKING CHANGE: The APIs have all been rewritten because I felt like it
  ```

#### Valid commit types
```
build
ci
chore
docs
feat
fix
perf
refactor
revert
style
test
```

## Testing

### Component Snapshots

To run Jest snapshots on all component files with a `.spec.js` file, run:

```
npm run test
```

To update existing snapshots for components where their markup changes, run:

```
npm run test -- -u
```

### UI and Design Testing

Story Book is used to Visually test and showcase components. Run the following to build the storybook files and serve them on `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/*` respectively:

```
npm run build-storybook && npm run storybook
```

More on testing with the [Testing Readme](documentation/TESTING.md)

## Code Integrity

### Commenting

It is encouraged to write code that is [Self-documenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code), where as through functional programming, intelligent naming, and clearly laid out code intuitively describes what the code does.

In the event of more complex code, `@TODO` statements or tslint / eslint ignores, use double slash for single line comments that relate to a block of code. Slightly different for css:

```
// single line comment about the following code block
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

...

/* single line comment about the following code block */
.base {
  color: pink;
}
```

double slash for single line comments to the right of a single statement:

```
const add = (a, b) => a + b; // single line comment about this statement

...

.base {
  /* single line comment about this statement */
  color: pink;
}
```

and JSDoc format for multi line comments:

```
/**
 * multi line comment
 * about the following code block
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

...

/**
 * multi line comment
 * about the following code block
 */
.base {
  color: pink;
}
```

### Linting

The [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) and [.stylelintrc](.stylelintrc) files govern the code style and syntax rules for JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS files respectively.

The ESLint configuration for this project extends upon the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

To run the ESLint task, use:

```
npm run eslint
```

To run the StyleLint task, use:

```
npm run stylelint
```

`npm run lint` is an alias for both.

In regards to typing React components, use [React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-cheatsheet) as a reference. (Thank you @kevin-ho87)

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is used to maintain code style within the application. The changes to the base Prettier config for this application are configured in the [`.prettierrc`](.prettierrc) file. Use the following task to format CSS and JavaScript files.

```
npm run pretty
```

`npm run prettier-eslint` and `npm run prettier-stylelint` will independently run the relevant format task for JavaScript and CSS respectively.

### Pre Commit Hook

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to automatically run `npm run format` as a pre-commit hook, ensuring changes to
source files follow the same formatting. The configurations of Husky is found in [.huskyrc](.huskyrc).

.huskyrc

```
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "npm run pretty",
  }
}

```

### Issues

Code issues, update requests and development improvements that do not have a JIRA ticket should be made via an [issue submission](https://github.com/aesop/aesop-gel/issues).

Any `@TODO`s in the code base should have a corresponding issue submission.

### Contributing

#### Creating new components

Use the npm script to generate the new files for a new component.

```bash
npm run generate-component -- MyComponent
```

Pull Requests for any new feature, bug fix or update need to be made with the PR template provided via a [New Pull Request](https://github.com/aesop/aesop-gel/pulls). Every PR needs to be Peer Reviewed before it can be merged.
